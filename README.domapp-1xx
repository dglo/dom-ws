this is the domapp-1xx branch of dom-mb,
used as an interim placeholder for domapp
to compile against until the features
required by domapp are in mainline...

to release:

increment prod.num
make clean; make
./dorel.sh
add md5sum to releases.md5
cvs checkin
./tagprod.sh

from scratch:

make links
make PLATFORM=Linux-i386 iceboot
see release above...
