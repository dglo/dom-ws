* a stable release branch is made.  only
bugfixes go into this branch (az-prod-n).

* all patches must exist, work and be      
tested in the HEAD first _before_ going
into a stable release.

* all fw changes of any kind and all sw
changes (however small) affecting comms
require the full overnight moat test.  

* all fw changes involving comm get the
full overnight moat test at cold.

* all sw changes are reviewed carefully
by me before they go in.  i'm the only
one to checkin on the az-prod-n branch.

* all major sw changes require a test of
the candidate .hex file.

* all minor sw changes go in with no
additional testing.

* all releases are cleared by chuck before
publishing.

* release schedule is held to no more than
one release per week.
